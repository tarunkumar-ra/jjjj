        e 2022 Indian Premier League, also known as IPL 15 or, for sponsorship
        reasons, Tata IPL 2022,[2] is the fifteenth season of the Indian Premier
        League (IPL), a professional Twenty20 cricket league established by the
        Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) in 2007. The tournament is
        being played from 26 March 2022, and to be concluded with the final on
        29 May 2022. The group stage of the tournament is being played entirely
        in the state of Maharashtra, with Mumbai and Pune hosting the
        matches.[3] The full schedule of the tournament was announced on 6 March
        2022.[4] The season saw the expansion of the league, with the addition
        of two new franchises.[5][6] Therefore, this was the second season to
        have ten teams, after the 2011 tournament.[7] Chennai Super Kings are
        the defending champions, having won their fourth title during the
        previous season.[8] Contents 1 Background 2 Personnel changes 3 Format 4

        Although earlier reports suggested the addition of two more teams in the
        previous season,[9][10][11] the BCCI at their 89th AGM announced that
        the expansion of the league would occur only in 2022.[12][13] In August
        2021, the BCCI confirmed that two new franchises would join the league
        starting from the 2022 season. It was also announced that the franchises
        would be based in two of the six cities shortlisted by the BCCI;
        Ahmedabad, Cuttack, Dharamshala, Guwahati, Indore and Lucknow.[14][15]
        In a closed bidding held on 25 October 2021, RPSG Group and CVC Capital
        won bids for the two teams.[16][17] RPSG paid ₹7,090 crore (US$930
        million) for Lucknow, whereas CVC won Ahmedabad for ₹5,625 crore (US$740
        million).[18][19] The Lucknow team was named as Lucknow Super Giants on
        24 January 2022,[20] whereas the Ahmedabad team was named as Gujarat
        Titans on 9 February 2022.[21] Vivo pulled out as the title sponsor of
        the tournament on 11 January 2022. Vivo, having previously pulled out as
        sponsors in 2020, had signed contract as title sponsors till 2023. The
        Tata Group was named as the title sponsor for the remainder of Vivo's
        contract.[22][23] Personnel changes Main article: List of 2022 Indian
        Premier League personnel changes Each existing team was allowed to
        retain a maximum of four players, whereas the two new teams were allowed
        to pick a maximum of three players before the auction.[24] The retained
        players of the existing eight teams were announced on 30 November
        2021,[25][26] and the two new teams named their players on 22 January
        2022.[27][28] The auction took place on 12 and 13 February 2022 in
        Bangalore.[29] Ishan Kishan was the most expensive buy of the auction,
        bought by Mumbai Indians for ₹15.25 crore (US$2.0 million).[30] The most
        expensive foreign player was Liam Livingstone, bought by Punjab Kings
        for ₹11.50 crore (US$1.5 million).[31] Format With the introduction of
        the new teams, a ten-team format was created. This format consists of 74
        matches and was introduced as retaining the previous format would result
        in 94 matches, significantly greater than the 60 matches from the
        previous season, where teams compete in a double round-robin tournament.
        The ten teams are divided into two groups of five. In the group stage,
        each team plays 14 games: facing the other four teams in their group two
        times each (one home and one away game), four teams in the other group
        once, and the remaining team two times. The groups for the tournament
        were announced on 25 February 2022.[32] Each team plays the team in the
        same row and the same column twice, and all others once. For instance,
        Mumbai Indians will play Chennai Super Kings and the other Group A teams
        twice but the other teams from Group B (Sunrisers Hyderabad, Royal
        Challengers Bangalore, Punjab Kings and Gujarat Titans) only once.
        Similarly, Chennai will play Mumbai and the other Group B teams twice
        but all other teams from Group A only once. The format used is similar
        to the one used in 2011, with the only difference being that the teams
        were drawn according to seedings instead of being drawn randomly.[33]
